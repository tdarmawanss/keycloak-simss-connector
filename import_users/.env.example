# Keycloak Admin Credentials
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual credentials

# Option 1: Admin Username/Password Authentication
# Use these if you have admin user credentials
KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password_here

# Option 2: Service Account Client Credentials
# Use these if you have a service account configured in Keycloak
# with user management permissions (manage-users, view-users roles)
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=admin-cli
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here

# NOTE: You only need ONE of the above options, not both
# Option 1 is simpler if you have admin credentials
# Option 2 is more secure for production environments
